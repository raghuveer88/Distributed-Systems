## LAB - 2
1)Implement echo client server communication using UDP.  (Observe the difference in this program with TCP implementation) <br>
2)Create a multi-user group chat application using TCP. Your implementation will have one TCP server running, and multiple clients will connect to the server. Message sent by a client should be displayed to all other clients connected to the TCP server. <br/> 
Use threads to create separate sockets for clients. DONT use python 'select' library to read, and write from the sockets.<br/>
